## About this section

## Texts

In our experience, we've been trained on the bascis of remote sensing by Ian Woodhouse<sup>1</sup>, but we're well aware that there are so many other textbooks out there that are better suited towards different learners with any background that you can imagine. If there's a book or author that you've had great experiences with, let us know and we'll add it to our list of recommendations!
