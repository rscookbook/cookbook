# Personal Packing List for Winter Fieldwork Campaign
At the RSC, we’re gearing up to head up to northern Canada to conduct our second fieldwork campaign. Last campaign taught us a lot about what we should have packed, and what we should have left at home. We wanted to document what we found was helpful to bring with you when venturing out to perform data collection in cold remote areas. Ideas for this personal packing list have come from our own experience, as well as suggestions from seasoned outdoor researchers!

## Gear List
- Snowpant bibs (large pockets are very helpful and the more pockets the merrier)
  - We like the Carhartt or Tough Duck insulated bibs
- A warm parka
- Snow goggles (shaded lenses are great if you’re working outdoors during the day, especially in the snow)
- Thin, dextrous inner gloves (these are a must for when you have to take off your outer glovers to write or adjust equipment)
  - It’s a smart move to have two pairs of these on hand, because the odds of you getting a pair wet are there)
- Warm, waterproof outer gloves
- Hand + foot warmers (pack more than you expect you’ll need and always have a few spares on hand)
- Light, cold rated, waterproof winter boots
- Balaclava (It’s great to have two of these, so you can switch them out if you need to wash them)
- Toque
- Thermos + insulated water bottle
  - If not properly insulated, your water bottle will freeze while you’re outside working, so we recommend either bringing a thermos of water or utilizing a well-insulated container
- Head torch
  - Lithium battery-powered is a great option as most regular batteries will drain when left out in the cold
  - These are great for when you’re packing up items early in the morning and require some extra light
  - Petzel lamps are a trusted option
- Cured meat
  - If you aren’t working in an area where you expect to encounter wildlife **AKA Polar Bear Capital**, it may be handy to have a cured meat option with you when you go out in case you need some emergency calories.
  - Stay tuned for a fieldwork grocery recommendation guide from RSC!
- Waterproof notepad with pencil
  - Pens can freeze and writing usually becomes smudged
- Base layers
  - Merino wool is a great material option, but can be expensive
  - Fleece is a comfortable + cozy option
- Wool socks
  - We find that it’s usually our toes that become cold first, so it’s smart to invest in quality socks. The great thing about wool is that it inhibits odor-causing bacteria, so it’s a great material for fieldwork when you might not have access to a washing machine and have to wear your socks two days in a row!
  - J.B. Fields are a great Canadian-made option, but SmartWool products can easily be found as well. Walmart has some cheaper options for wool socks.
  - It’s also helpful to get tight-fitting socks so that it’s less likely they slide off your feet while you’re walking around 
- One of your favourite games
  - We spent the majority of our group-based downtime as a team playing card games (dutch blitz) or computer trivia games. It’s important that when you’re conducting a campaign that lasts weeks or months that you find ways to connect with your peers outside of working. Don’t get us wrong, you will still need your quiet alone time, but fieldwork can feel lonely if you don’t find appropriate ways to unwind as a team.
- Personalized gifts
  - This item is not always appropriate, or necessary, so we recommend chatting with your field lead in advance prior to preparing any gifts.
  - When we travel for fieldwork, we often work alongside many helpful and knowledgeable individuals. These people might be local community members, or staff at our accommodations, who always seem to make our lives quite a bit easier, and safer, while collecting data. To thank them, we try to prepare personalized items that we gift to them as a lab.

## Sourcing cost Effective Gear 
Personal equipment can be quite expensive—especially if it’s your first campaign. We have a couple of tips that might help your wallet out when sourcing gear for winter work:
-	If you don’t already know, there are a few outfitter companies that provide decent discounts on their products for those who are professionals in their fields. Similar to a military discount, you may be able to use your standing as a professional researcher to save a few bucks at checkout. An example of this is [Outdoor Research’s Pro Program](https://www.outdoorresearch.com/en-ca/pages/pro-program?srsltid=AfmBOorytKnusxV-LEKdQ2ZVgrX18e6cx76bTARH3yF98Vv9_VrcevA9)—although there are limitations to these types of discounts (limited membership duration, limited product eligibility, etc…). It may be worth checking out whether the products you’re interested in could be discounted further before purchase!
-	Check out Facebook Marketplace/Poshmark/Kijiji/Local Equipment Swaps/Thrift Shops for gently-used items. Many of the individuals within our labspace have had great success finding high-quality used items locally for a great price. The downfall to this is that you have to keep your eyes peeled for items amidst endless postings/racks. Make sure to check online to ensure that you’re getting a good deal and double check used equipment for wear and tear prior to purchasing! Bonus points if you can re-sell equipment that you no longer need after all of your campaigns are complete.
