# Glossary

## A

**Active remote sensing** — Remote-sensing methods that provide their own source of electromagnetic radiation to illuminate the terrain (e.g., radar, LiDAR).

**Albedo** — The ratio of the amount of electromagnetic energy reflected by a surface to the amount of energy incident upon it.

**Analog(ue)** — A representation that is continuous, not made up of discrete numerical values. In remote sensing: film photography or other non-digital imagery.

**Application** — The end purpose for which remote sensing is used (e.g., mapping, monitoring, environmental assessment).

**Amplitude** — For waves, the maximum displacement from equilibrium (i.e., “height” of the wave).

## B

**Band** — A segment of the electromagnetic spectrum captured by a sensor; remote sensing instruments often record multiple bands (e.g., visible, infrared, microwave).

**Backscatter** — Energy that, after hitting a target, is scattered back in the direction of the sensor/illumination source. Particularly relevant for active sensors (e.g., radar).

**Bathymetry** — Measurement of the depth of water bodies, often inferred via remote sensing techniques (e.g. altimeters, radar, LiDAR over water).

## C

**Cloud** (in imagery) — (from remote-sensing context) – usually refers to clouds in the atmosphere that may occlude surface reflectance in optical imagery.

**Classification** — The process of assigning pixels or objects in remote-sensing data to categorical classes (e.g., land cover types).

**Composite Image** (Mosaic / Composite) — A single image produced by combining, mosaicking or compositing multiple images (often to cover a larger geographic area or reduce cloud effects).

**Coordinate Reference System** (CRS) — The coordinate-based system used to map image data or spatial data to real-world positions (geolocation).

## D

**Digital data / Digital image** — Data represented by numerical values (e.g., pixel values) rather than analog — the standard for modern remote-sensing imagery.

**Digital number (DN)** — The numerical value assigned to a pixel in a digital remote-sensing image, representing intensity (e.g., reflectance, backscatter).

**Distortion** — Changes in shape or position of objects in an image relative to their true ground geometry, often introduced by sensors, scanning, or projection.

**Doppler shift / Doppler principle** — Change in observed frequency of waves due to motion between source and observer; relevant for certain radar-based remote-sensing and atmospheric sensing methods.

## E

**Electromagnetic radiation** — Energy propagated via oscillating electric and magnetic fields; remote-sensing relies on detecting electromagnetic radiation (reflected or emitted) from the Earth.

**Electromagnetic spectrum** — The full range of wavelengths or frequencies of electromagnetic radiation (visible, infrared, microwave, etc.) — sensors exploit different parts of the spectrum depending on application.

**Emission** — Process by which a body radiates electromagnetic energy (e.g., thermal emission, natural earth emission).

**Emission vs Reflection vs Transmission** — Ways in which EM energy interacts with objects/targets: energy can be emitted (thermal), reflected (e.g., sunlight off surfaces), or transmitted through materials depending on their properties.

## G

**Ground truthing (Ground truth / Ground-truth data / Validation)** — Field measurements or in-situ observations used to verify, calibrate, or validate remote-sensing derived information.

**GIS (Geographic Information System)** — A system for storing, analyzing, and visualizing spatial/geographic data. Remote-sensing data (rasters or derived vectors) are often used within a GIS framework.

## I

**Image (Imagery)** — The picture/data produced by a remote sensing sensor — typically a raster composed of many pixels, possibly across multiple spectral bands.

**Image analysis / Digital image processing** — The process of manipulating, interpreting and extracting information from digital remote-sensing images (e.g., classification, feature extraction, enhancement).

**Index (Spectral index)** — A derived product calculated from combinations of spectral bands (e.g., ratios, differences) designed to highlight certain surface/material properties (vegetation, water, snow, etc.). This is foundational for feature extraction. {Note: while not always labeled “index” in older glossaries, the concept arises in spectral reflectance discussions — see spectral reflectance entry below.}

**IFOV (Instantaneous Field of View)** — Angular cone through which a sensor views the ground at any given moment; it defines the ground footprint for a given measurement.

## M

**Mixed pixel (Mixel)** — A pixel whose recorded value represents a mixture of several surface types/features within its footprint (e.g., part vegetation, part bare ground) — common in coarse-resolution data.

**Mosaic** — A large image created by combining (stitching) multiple adjacent images, often used to cover large areas or to overcome scene limitations (e.g., clouds).

**Multispectral / Hyperspectral** — Sensors that record data in multiple (multispectral) or many (hyperspectral) spectral bands, enabling discrimination of materials based on their spectral signatures. {Note: “multispectral imaging” is often simply referenced under “band” and “sensor” concepts.}

## P

**Passive remote sensing** — Remote sensing methods that record naturally reflected or emitted electromagnetic radiation (e.g., sunlight reflected from Earth's surface, or thermal emission). Most optical satellite imagery is passive.

**Pixel** — The smallest unit in a digital image, representing a ground area (footprint) and associated digital value(s) (DN, or reflectance/backscatter/etc.).

**Platform** — The carrier of a sensor — typically a satellite or aircraft, but potentially a drone, balloon, tower, etc.

**Projection / Map projection** — The method used to represent the curved surface of the Earth on a flat map/image, often used when georeferencing remote-sensing data (e.g., conic projection).

## R

**Radar remote sensing** — A type of active remote sensing using microwave radiation to “illuminate” the ground and measuring backscatter; useful for all-weather, day/night imaging, sensitive to surface structure, moisture, and roughness.

**Radiometric resolution** — The number of discrete intensity levels a sensor can record per pixel (e.g., 8-bit -> 256 levels; 12-bit -> 4096 levels). Higher radiometric resolution allows finer gradations of reflectance or backscatter values.

**Reflectance / Reflection** — The fraction of incident electromagnetic radiation that is reflected by a surface. Reflectance (or spectral reflectance) across wavelengths can be used to infer material or surface properties.

**Resolution** — Generic term describing the “detail” level of remote-sensing data; commonly subdivided into:

  - **Spatial resolution** — size of the ground footprint (pixel size).

  - **Spectral resolution** — number and width of spectral bands a sensor acquires.

  - **Temporal resolution** — how often a sensor revisits the same area (important for change detection, time series).

## S

**Satellite** — A man-made object orbiting Earth (or another planet) carrying remote-sensing sensor(s), used to collect imagery or other remote-sensing data.

**Scene** — The area on the ground covered by a single image acquisition (i.e., the footprint of a satellite or airborne image).

**Sensor** — The device (instrument) that records electromagnetic radiation (reflected or emitted) from the Earth or target — analogous to a camera, scanner, radiometer, LiDAR, SAR, etc.

**Spectral reflectance / Spectral signature** — The reflectance of a surface as a function of wavelength. Different materials/surfaces have characteristic spectral signatures used for material discrimination, classification, and feature extraction.

## T

**Transmission (Transmit)** — When electromagnetic energy passes through a material without being reflected or absorbed; in remote sensing, certain wavelengths may transmit through media (e.g., atmosphere) to reach Earth’s surface or penetrate water/vegetation.
