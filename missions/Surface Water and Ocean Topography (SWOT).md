# Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) Mission Overview

## Mission Purpose
The SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) mission—developed jointly by NASA and CNES, with support from CSA and UKSA—is the first satellite designed to survey Earth’s surface water globally. It captures detailed observations of oceans, lakes, rivers, and wetlands with unmatched resolution, enabling better understanding of water dynamics over time and across scales.

## Mission Details
- **Launch**: December 16, 2022 via Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg SLC-4E
- **Orbit**: Low Earth, inclined (77.6°), non-sun-synchronous, ~102.9 min period, ~21-day repeat cycle
- **Coverage**: Reaches ~78°S to 78°N, covering ~86% of the globe every three weeks
- **Key Instruments**:
  - **KaRIn** (Ka-band Radar Interferometer): wide-swath elevation mapping
  - **Altimeter**, **AMR-C**, **DORIS**, **GPSP**, **LRA** for auxiliary measurements

## Data Access
SWOT data is available through NASA's PO.DAAC and the AVISO portal, including hydrology and oceanography products, release notes, user guides, and the SWOT Data User Handbook (Rev A, March 2025). Interactive tutorials and resources—like the PO.DAAC Cookbook and HiTIDE tool—help users subset and download KaRIn data.

## What to Know Before Working with SWOT Data
- **Novelty & Complexity**: SWOT's wide-swath interferometry is groundbreaking—bringing unique engineering and data processing challenges while offering tremendous opportunities for scientific discovery.
- **Community Value**: Data from SWOT enhances models across hydrology, climate, ecosystems, and more. Inland water dynamics, water-carbon interactions, and vertical water flux are expected to benefit significantly.
- **Applications & Impact**:
  - Ocean currents, coastal dynamics, floodplain monitoring, freshwater management, and decision support for transboundary water sharing
  - Notably, SWOT enabled mapping of the ocean floor (revealing abyssal hills and seamounts via sea surface variations) and, for the first time, detection of long “flow waves” in rivers—enhancing flood-risk understanding.
